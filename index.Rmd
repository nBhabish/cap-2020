####.right2[ The moment I read the email about the program, I thought it would be something that would keep me busy during the pandemic. I believed participating in this program would give me an opportunity to work on things that I thought I would work on if I had some extra time. Not only that, just signing up would keep me accountable and help me stay motivated because it had something to do with the college. Rightfully so, it did and I am glad that I decided to participate in the program. The things that I was able to accomplish and the things that I was able to further explore have made me realize how valuable my participation turned out to be. And, I can not stress enough how much Lauren Stehlik, my coach, help me stay motivated.]
